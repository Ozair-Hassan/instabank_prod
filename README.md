Technologies Used

This project is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The application structure is component-based, allowing for reusable code and efficient development. The styling is managed through a combination of CSS and styled-components, providing a flexible way to style the application while keeping the concerns of styling and element logic separate.

Here is a brief overview of the main technologies used:

React.js: The core framework for building the UI.
CSS: For styling components and pages.
Styled-Components: To enhance CSS styling in React components.
React Three Fiber: For 3D animations and effects.
EmailJS: To handle email sending directly from the frontend.
